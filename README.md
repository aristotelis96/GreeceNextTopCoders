# Student offers

A website using Express.js and MySQL for the backend and Bootstrap and AngularJS for the frontend. The website features a user-friendly interface that enables students to track and filter offers for students across various categories. Additionally, students can contribute and log offers that are not yet on the website, making it a valuable resource for students seeking deals and discounts. Finally the project provides a fully functional API that allows for easy insertion, modification, and deletion of data.
